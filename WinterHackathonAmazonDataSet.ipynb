      "description       Jane Eyre, aged 10, lives at Gateshead Hall with her maternal uncle's family, the Reeds, as a result of her uncle's dying wish. Jane was orphaned several years earlier when her parents died of typhus. Mr. Reed, Jane's uncle, was the only member of the Reed family who was ever kind to Jane. Jane's aunt, Sarah Reed, dislikes her, abuses her, and treats her as a burden, and Mrs. Reed discourages her three children from associating with Jane. Jane, as a result, becomes defensive against her cruel judgement. The nursemaid, Bessie, proves to be Jane's only ally in the household, even though Bessie occasionally scolds Jane harshly. Excluded from the family activities, Jane leads an unhappy childhood, with only a doll and books with which to entertain herself.One day, as punishment for defending herself against her cousin John Reed, Jane is relegated to the red room in which her late uncle had died; there, she faints from panic after she thinks she has seen his ghost. The red room is significant because it lays the grounds for the \"ambiguous relationship between parents and children\" which plays out in all of Jane's future relationships with male figures throughout the novel.\n",

      "description       Published on 16 October 1847, Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre was originally titled Jane Eyre: An Autobiography. The novel earned its author the distinction of being ‘the first historian of the private consciousness’. Jane Eyre, an orphan, living with her cruel aunt is punished for bullying her cousin and imprisoned in a ‘red room’. This is the same room where Jane’s uncle had died. Locked in, a young Jane is haunted by her uncle’s screams. Memories of an oppressive upbringing follow her like a shadow even at Lowood Charity School where she finds herself at the mercy of an abusive headmaster. As a governess at Thornfield Hall, Jane falls in love with her mysterious Byronic employer, Edward Rochester. Soon, she discovers a bitter truth about him and his ‘mad’ wife Bertha Mason. After a series of crests and troughs when Jane is ready to embark on yet another unpredictable journey, she is compelled to return to the man she had once abandoned.\n",
